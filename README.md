# Face-mask-detector
Face mask detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces with or without the mask in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face mask detection has gained a lot of importance, especially due to this COVID-19 pandemic. 

Amidst COVID19 we cannot step outside, and even if we have to, we have to use masks. It is observed that a lot of people neglect wearing masks. This can be dangerous for them as well as the people around them.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.There are bindings in Python. OpenCV already has two pre-trained face detection classifiers, which can readily be used in a program.  
There are some simple operations on images using OpenCV like opening         images, drawing simple shapes on images and interacting with images through call backs.  
 
Haar-like features are digital image features used in object recognition. This classifier is widely used for tasks like face detection in computer vision industry. Haar cascade classifier employs a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates.
